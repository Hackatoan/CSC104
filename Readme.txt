- Allows users to play songs directly from the library or from custom playlists.
- Users can create playlists and add songs to them.
- A persistent player bar provides controls for play/pause, next/previous, volume, shuffle, and loop.
- All playlist data is saved in the browser's local storage, so they will be available on subsequent visits.

*there is also a dynamic version where the songs are grabbed from the folder but that is outside the scope of this assignment
